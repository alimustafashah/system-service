Improvements:

* Replace hash function used in hashtable.c (function ht_index) with a better option to reduce the number of hash colisions.

* Improve error management including the usage of errno.

* Create debug and error log functions, and a configuration way to enable debug log traces. The result should be printed out in system log.

* Create a test environment and a target in Makefile to install it and run it.

* Analyze the source code with Valgrind to found memory leak errors.
